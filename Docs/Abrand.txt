this can become a brand only when the product becomes 
a part of the daily lingo of normal people.
"Hey man did you finish todays escape?"
"omg did you see the new prizes for the number one escape artist?"
"im ranked 50th on the regionals list (escape artist)"

it needs the following for it to work;
1. proper, strategic marketing and impregnation of the idea of the brand into people's minds.
2. appropriate reward mechanisms - physical in my case as tangible rewards = a tangible brand -
irreplacable in my opinion and I forsee it being one of the USPs. 
3. giving appropriate recognition to winners and streaks and shit. not too tacky like 
QuizUp but simillar. everything needs to feel organic with the right amount of sharpness/citrus
if you catch my drift.
